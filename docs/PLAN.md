# Matcha Jump - Development Plan

## üéÆ Current State (December 2024)

### ‚úÖ What We've Built So Far

#### Core Game Architecture
- **Event-driven system** using `mitt` for decoupled communication between game components
- **Game Engine** (`GameEngine.js`) - Handles game loop with deltaTime capping, rendering pipeline
- **Camera System** (`Camera.js`) - Implements upward-scrolling viewport that follows the player
- **Asset Loader** (`AssetLoader.js`) - Preloads all game images with progress tracking
- **Farcaster Frame Integration** - Set up with proper meta tags, SDK initialization, and haptic feedback

#### Game Entities
1. **Player** (`Player.js`)
   - Physics-based movement with gravity (800 units/s¬≤) and jump mechanics
   - Velocity capped at 600 units/s for fall speed
   - Jump power of -500 units/s (normal) and -800 units/s (spring platforms)
   - **Advanced Animation System:**
     - Dramatic squash (1.5x wide, 0.5x tall) and stretch (0.7x wide, 1.4x tall)
     - Super jump has even more dramatic stretch (0.6x wide, 1.6x tall)
     - Rotation based on horizontal movement
     - Landing recovery with overshoot animation
     - Smooth easing functions for natural movement
   - Mobile controls: Touch left/right halves of screen
   - Desktop controls: Arrow keys
   - Automatic edge wrapping when moving off-screen

2. **Platforms** (`Platform.js`)
   - **Four types fully implemented:**
     - Normal (green) - Standard platform using `plate_rectangle_1.png`
     - Moving (blue) - Moves horizontally using `plate_rectangle_2.png`
     - Breakable (red) - Disappears after one bounce using `plate_rectangle_3.png`
     - Spring (yellow) - Super jump with bounce animation using `plate_circle.png`
   - Spring platforms animate when used (scale bounce effect)
   - Spawn rates: 10% moving, 5% breakable, 3% spring

3. **Collectibles** (`Coin.js`)
   - Animated coins with rotation and floating motion
   - Magnetic attraction when player is near
   - Collection particles on pickup
   - Score rewards with combo multipliers

4. **Power-ups** (`PowerUp.js`, `PowerUpManager.js`)
   - **Five types implemented:**
     - **Rocket** - Continuous upward boost (3 seconds)
     - **Shield** - One-time fall protection
     - **Magnet** - Attracts coins from greater distance (5 seconds)
     - **Score Boost** - 2x score multiplier (10 seconds)
     - **Slow Time** - Time dilation effect (visual only, mechanics not implemented)
   - Visual indicators for active power-ups
   - Duration timers and proper cleanup

#### Game Systems

1. **Combo System** (`ComboManager.js`)
   - Tracks consecutive perfect landings on platforms
   - Combo multipliers affect scoring (1x, 1.5x, 2x, 3x)
   - Milestone bonuses at 5, 10, 20+ combos
   - Visual feedback with particles for milestones
   - Combo breaks on missed platforms

2. **Audio System** (`AudioManager.js`, `GameSynth.js`)
   - **Sophisticated synthesizer-based sound effects using Tone.js:**
     - Jump sounds with pitch variation based on velocity
     - Landing thuds with low-frequency impact
     - Coin collection jingles
     - Spring bounce with characteristic "boing"
     - Platform break sounds
     - Power-up collection fanfares
     - Game over sequence
     - Ambient background chords
   - Web Audio API for better mobile performance
   - Automatic audio context resume on user interaction

3. **Particle System** (`ParticleManager.js`, `Particle.js`)
   - Jump dust particles
   - Landing impact particles
   - Platform break particles (red debris)
   - Coin collection sparkles (yellow)
   - Rocket boost trails (orange/red)
   - Shield break effects (blue)
   - Combo milestone celebrations (rainbow colors)
   - Performance-optimized with automatic cleanup

#### Game States & UI
- **Menu** - Shows game title and tap to start
- **Playing** - Active gameplay with score tracking
- **Game Over** - Shows final score and high score
- **Score persistence** using localStorage
- **Mobile-optimized UI** with fading touch instructions

#### Mobile & Frame Features
- Touch controls with subtle text hint that fades after 3 seconds
- Prevented zoom and scroll on mobile devices
- Haptic feedback integration:
  - Light haptic on normal platform landing
  - Heavy haptic on spring platform and game over
- Responsive canvas sizing with proper DPI scaling
- Frame V2 ready state signaling
