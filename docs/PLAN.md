# Matcha Jump - Development Plan

## üéÆ Current State (January 2025)

### ‚úÖ What We've Built So Far

#### Core Game Architecture
- **Event-driven system** using `mitt` for decoupled communication between game components
- **Game Engine** (`GameEngine.js`) - Handles game loop with deltaTime capping, rendering pipeline

- **Farcaster Frame Integration** - Set up with proper meta tags, SDK initialization, and haptic feedback

#### Game Entities
1. **Player** (`Player.js`)

   - Velocity capped at 600 units/s for fall speed
   - Jump power of -500 units/s (normal) and -800 units/s (spring platforms)
   - **Advanced Animation System:**
     - Dramatic squash (1.5x wide, 0.5x tall) and stretch (0.7x wide, 1.4x tall)
     - Super jump has even more dramatic stretch (0.6x wide, 1.6x tall)
     - Rotation based on horizontal movement
     - Landing recovery with overshoot animation
     - Smooth easing functions for natural movement
